# Scrolling logos

Have you ever needed to show off a bunch of images? Like logos of companies
that support your Open Source initiative? Look no further ðŸ˜‰

## Demo

See here for the working demo: https://nuts-foundation.github.io/scrolling-logos/nuts

## Running locally

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:nuts-foundation/scrolling-logos.git
$ cd scrolling-logos
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then see the `_data/` directory and `nuts.html` for an example of how to add a
new screen with different logos.
